Hackathon with Smarth Sharma


"I worship that supreme soul, the one, the primordial seed of the universe, desireless, formless, knowable through Om. From whom the universe originates, by whom it is sustained, and into whom it dissolves."

"परात्मानमेकं जगद्बीजमाद्यं निरीहं निराकारमोंकारवेद्यम्।
        यतो जायते पाल्यते येन विश्वं तमीशं भजे लीयते यत्र विश्वम्।|


"Just as a flower, when it falls, spreads its fragrance all around. Similarly, good people should always do deeds that are beneficial to all."

यथा पुष्पं न पात्येत वासितं हि समन्ततः।
        तथा सत्पुरुषैर्नित्यं कार्यं यत्सर्वहिताय वै॥



"I bow to the moon, Soma, born from the milk ocean, white as conch and snow, the ornament on Shiva's crown."

 दधिशङ्खतुषाराभं क्षीरोदार्णवसम्भवम्।
        नमामि शशिनं सोमं शम्भोर्मुकुटभूषणम्॥



Based on your goal of making a "good aesthetic website," here's my recommendation:

1. Top Choice: 3. Jeevan-Amrit (Health & Wellness)

This is your strongest option by far. Wellness apps are all about aesthetics. The entire point is to "promote physical and mental balance," which is achieved through a calming, beautiful, and intuitive user interface (UI/UX).

Why it's a fit: You can focus on clean design, soothing colors, elegant data visualization (for wellness tracking), and a great user experience. This plays right into your strengths as a "creative tech mix."

Shloka Connection: It will also be much easier to find shlokas from your list that relate to "life," "balance," "mind," and "health" to integrate into this theme.
